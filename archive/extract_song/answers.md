Delete all lines enclosed by numbers into the named register `a`.
(Use capital A for appending instead of overwritting the register contents.)
One can navigate to them in normal mode with `/<number><CR>`,
where <CR> stands for Enter.

@a already contains a newline character, so that the following writes to it
will not appear on the one line. (That is how it works in Neovim at the date of
uploading this task.)

Don't reformat the background text manually after the deletion.
Instead, visually select the area you want to reformat and press `gq`.

He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, everyone recognised Him. That might
be one of the best passages in the poem. I mean, why they recognised Him. The people are
irresistibly drawn to Him, they surround Him, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves
silently in their midst with a gentle smile of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns
in His heart, and power shine from His eyes, and their radiance, shed on the people, stirs
their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His hands to them, blesses them, and a
healing virtue comes from contact with Him, even with His garments. An old man in the
crowd, blind from childhood, cries out, 'O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!' and, as it
were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The crowd weeps and kisses the
earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. 'It is
He- it is He!' repeat. 'It must be He, it can be no one but Him!' He stops at the steps of
the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little
open white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen.
The dead child lies hidden in flowers. 'He will raise your child,' the crowd shouts to the
weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but
the mother of the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. 'If it is Thou, raise
my child!' she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the coffin is
laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His lips once more softly
pronounce, 'Maiden, arise!' and the maiden arises. The little girl sits up in the coffin
and looks round, smiling with wide-open wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses
they had put in her hand.

There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the cardinal
himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety,
tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of
light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was the day before, when
he was burning the enemies of the Roman Church- at this moment he is wearing his coarse,
old, monk's cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and slaves and
the 'holy guard.' He stops at the sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance. He
sees everything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and
his face darkens. He knits his thick grey brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire.
He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely
are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd
immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands
on Him and lead him away. The crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before
the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on' The guards lead their
prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison- in the ancient palace of the Holy,
inquisition and shut him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning,
'breathless' night of Seville. The air is 'fragrant with laurel and lemon.' In the pitch
darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself
comes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He
stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face. At last he goes up
slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks.

'Is it Thou? Thou?' but receiving no answer, he adds at once. 'Don't answer, be silent.
What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right
to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For
Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost thou know what will be
to-morrow? I know not who Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou or only a
semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn Thee at the stake as the
worst of heretics. And the very people who have to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the
faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes,
maybe Thou knowest it,' he added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment taking
his eyes off the Prisoner.

<PASTE IT BELOW> (in normal mode type on this line: "ap )

You can blame me for the world is mad
And the good old rock'n'roll is dead
Burning down like falling stars
Wasting life behind the bars
Life of ignorance is bliss
And I don't know why I'm doing this
You can take me for what I am
I was born a wild man, hey!

Don't crucify me, I'm no Jesus
I'm a sinner and a prodigal son
Don't crucify me, I'm no Jesus
I'm a sinner

I've been traveling seven seas
Trains and highways and STDs
Fell in love a million times
Drank tequila and got high
You can blame me for the world is mad
And the good old rock'n'roll is dead
You can take me for what I am
I was born a wild man, hey!
