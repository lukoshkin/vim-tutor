Delete all lines enclosed by numbers into the named register `a`.
(Use capital A for appending instead of overwritting the register contents.)
One can navigate to them in normal mode with `/<number><CR>`,
where <CR> stands for Enter.

@a already contains a newline character, so that the following writes to it
will not appear on the one line. (That is how it works in Neovim at the date of
uploading this task.)

Don't reformat the background text manually after the deletion.
Instead, visually select the area you want to reformat and press `gq`.

He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, everyone recognised Him. That might
be one of the best passages in the poem. 1 You can blame me for the world is mad1 I mean,
why they recognised Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to Him, they surround Him, they
flock about Him, follow Him. He moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile of
infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His heart, and power shine from His eyes,
and their radiance, shed on the people, stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds
out His hands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with Him,
even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, 2 And the good old rock'n'roll is dead
Burning down like falling stars2 blind from childhood, cries out, 'O Lord, heal me and I
shall see Thee!' and, as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him.
The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before Him,
sing, and cry hosannah. 'It is He- it is He!' repeat. 3 Wasting life behind the bars3 'It
must be He, it can be no one but Him!' He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at
the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin. In it
lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen. The dead child lies
hidden in flowers. 'He will raise your child,' 4 Life of ignorance is bliss4 the crowd
shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and
frowns, but the mother of the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. 'If it is
Thou, raise my child!' she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the
coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His lips once more
softly pronounce, 5 And I don't know why I'm doing this5 'Maiden, arise!' and the maiden
arises. The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling with wide-open
wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had put in her hand.

There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the cardinal
himself, 6 You can take me for what I am6 the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral.
He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken eyes, in
which there is still a gleam of light. 7 I was born a wild man, hey!

7 He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was the day before, when he
was burning the enemies of the Roman Church- at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old,
monk's cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and slaves and the
'holy guard.' He stops at the sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance. He sees
everything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, 8 Don't crucify me, I'm no Jesus
I'm a sinner and a prodigal son8 sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He knits
his thick grey brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and
bids the guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into
submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the
guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead him away. The
crowd instantly bows down to the earth, 9 Don't crucify me, I'm no Jesus9 like one man,
before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on' The guards lead
their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison- in the ancient palace of the Holy,
inquisition and shut him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning,
'breathless' night of Seville. 10 I'm a sinner

10 The air is 'fragrant with laurel and lemon.' In the pitch darkness the iron door of the
prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his
hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for
a minute or two gazes into His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the
table and speaks.11 I've been traveling seven seas11

12 Trains and highways and STDs12 Fell in love a million times12 'Is it Thou? Thou?' but
receiving no answer, he adds at once. 'Don't answer, be silent. What canst Thou say,
indeed? I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to
what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to
hinder us, 13 Drank tequila and got high13 You can blame me for the world is mad13 and
Thou knowest that. But dost thou know what will be to-morrow? I know not who Thou art and
care not to know whether it is Thou or only a semblance of Him, but to-morrow I shall
condemn Thee and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very people who
have to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up
the embers of Thy fire. Knowest Thou that? Yes, 14 And the good old rock'n'roll is dead
You can take me for what I am14 maybe Thou knowest it,' he added with thoughtful
penetration, never for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner.
15 I was born a wild man, hey!15
